To develop and test the poultry disease classification model efficiently, I created a custom dataset tailored for lightweight experimentation and faster iteration.

Custom Dataset Structure:

My dataset is organized into two primary directories:

train/: Contains 200 images per class

test/: Contains 50 images per class

Scaling Up with the Kaggle Dataset
For more robust training and higher model performance, we recommend using the full dataset available on Kaggle:

üìÅ Kaggle Dataset Structure
train/: 100,000 images per class

val/: 10,000 images per class

test/: Remaining images for evaluation

This dataset provides a much larger and more diverse image pool, which can significantly improve model generalization and accuracy in real-world applications.
