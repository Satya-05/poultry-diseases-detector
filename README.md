üêî Project Title: Deep Learning‚ÄìPowered Poultry Disease Classification from Images
Description: This project presents an intelligent image classification system designed to identify common poultry diseases using deep learning. The model is trained on a curated dataset of chicken images representing four categories: Coccidiosis, Salmonella, Newcastle Disease, and Healthy. Leveraging transfer learning with the VGG16 architecture, the system accurately classifies input images and provides diagnostic insight.

The goal is to empower poultry farmers and veterinarians with a fast, accessible tool for early disease detection. By uploading an image of a chicken through a web interface or application, users receive instant feedback on the bird‚Äôs health status. This solution supports proactive farm management, reduces mortality rates, and enhances overall productivity in poultry operations.

The project includes:

A balanced and preprocessed image dataset

A transfer learning pipeline using VGG16

Evaluation metrics including accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curves

Visualization of model predictions and misclassifications

Exportable model for deployment in real-world applications

This work demonstrates how AI can be applied to agriculture and animal health, bridging the gap between technology and sustainable farming.
